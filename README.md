## How To Play

In this game, you are Leon S. Kenney and you will square off against Mr. X. Each will be given a certain amount of health.

For each round, you will be asked to guess a random number between 1 and 5.
If your guess matches the random number of the enemy -- your character inflicts a random amount of damage between 1 and 5.
If your guess does not match the random number of the enemy -- they will inflict a random amount of damage to your character between 1 and 5.  Each round the enemy is given a new random number and you must guess again.

The game ends when Leon or Mr. X gets to 0 health.
